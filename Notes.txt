max queue length = team capacity * 1.5

if office hours (8-16 hours) and max queue length, add overflow team

max concurrency (chats per agent) = 10 

efficiency multiplier:
junior = 10 * 0.4 = 4
midlevel = 10 * 0.6 = 6 
senior = 10 * 0.8 = 8
teamlead = 10 * 0.5 = 5

Team Capacity:
Team A = 5 + 12 + 4 = 21
Team B = 8 + 6 + 8 = 22
Team C = 12
OT = 24
